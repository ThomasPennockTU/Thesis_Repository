  CONTACT INTERACTIONS IN STEP 1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  No initial node-face overclosures found.


  Abaqus/Explicit will attempt to resolve 54 initial edge-edge overclosure(s).


  Maximum initial overclosure for edge-edge contact is 6.51926E-09 between the
  edge defined by nodes 48 and 72 of instance BLOCK-2-LIN-1-3-LIN-11-1 and the
  edge defined by nodes 137 and 161 of instance
  BLOCK-2-LIN-1-8-LIN-2-1-LIN-LIN-10-1-3


  Abaqus/Explicit will attempt to resolve 18 initial node-analytical rigid
  surface overclosure(s).

  BLOCK-2-LIN-1-8-LIN-2-1-LIN-LIN-11-1-5 and the analytical rigid surface with
  reference node 1 of instance         .


  No nodal position adjustments have been made.


  No node-face overclosures left unresolved.


  54 edge-edge overclosure(s) left unresolved and will be stored as offsets.
  To help identify the nodes involved in the overclosures a node set
  InfoNodeUnresolvInitOver has been created.

  nodes 48 and 72 of instance BLOCK-2-LIN-1-3-LIN-11-1 and the edge defined by

***ERROR: There are a total of 2 excessively distorted elements


***ERROR: The ratio of deformation speed to wave speed exceeds 1.0000 in at
          least one element. This usually indicates an error with the model
          definition. Additional diagnostic information may be found in the
          message file.


The following checklist may be helpful in diagnosing the error:

    1. Check contact definitions for problems such as excessive initial
       overclosure or unrealistic tied definition between contact pairs.
       A vector plot of velocities or accelerations will usually help to
       identify contact problems.

    2. Check stiffness (elastic modulus) and mass (density) definitions for
       consistent units and verify that the combination is reasonable.

    3. Check for poor mesh definition.

    4. Check the boundary conditions for an excessive loading rate. The
       *DIAGNOSTICS, DEFORMATION SPEED CHECK=DETAIL option may be used to obtain
       detailed diagnostics information.

    5. Check the current status of the structure to see if it has
       totally failed.

    6. A dashpot or a very stiff spring may cause the analysis to go unstable.
       The *DYNAMIC, DIRECT option may be used to control the time increment
       directly.


***ERROR: The fatal error will generate a new field output in the last
          increment. All variables applicable to the current procedure and
          material type(s) will be written to the output database.
