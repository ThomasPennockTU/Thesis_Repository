 STABLE TIME INCREMENT INFORMATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  The stable time increment estimate for each element is based on
  linearization about the initial state.


   Initial time increment = 1.25107E-05

   Statistics for all elements:
      Mean = 1.27962E-05
      Standard deviation = 0.0000

   Most critical elements:

  INFORMATION REGARDING INITIAL CONTACT OVERCLOSURES FOR NEWLY DEFINED GENERAL
  CONTACT INTERACTIONS IN STEP 1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  No initial node-face overclosures found.


  Abaqus/Explicit will attempt to resolve 1344 initial edge-edge
  overclosure(s).


  Maximum initial overclosure for edge-edge contact is 1.28616E-06 between the
  edge defined by nodes 137 and 161 of instance
  BLOCK-2-LIN-1-8-LIN-2-1-LIN--LIN-9-1 and the edge defined by nodes 72 and 96
  of instance HALFBLOCK-1-LIN-10-1


  Abaqus/Explicit will attempt to resolve 119 initial node-analytical rigid
  surface overclosure(s).


  Maximum initial overclosure for node-analytical rigid surface contact is
  5.60776E-06 between secondary node 25 of instance
  BLOCK-2-LIN-1-8-LIN-2-1-LIN-LIN-11-1 and the analytical rigid surface with
  reference node 1 of instance         .


  Maximum initial contact adjustment is: 1.02104E-07 at node 65 of instance
  HALFBLOCK-1-LIN-1-2-LIN-6-1.


  No node-face overclosures left unresolved.


  1339 edge-edge overclosure(s) left unresolved and will be stored as offsets.
  To help identify the nodes involved in the overclosures a node set
  InfoNodeUnresolvInitOver has been created.


  Maximum unresolved overclosure is 1.28616E-06 between the edge defined by
  nodes 41 and 65 of instance BLOCK-2-LIN-1-8-LIN-2-1-LIN-9-1 and the edge
  defined by nodes 72 and 96 of instance HALFBLOCK-1-LIN-1-2-LIN-10-1


  119 node-analytical rigid surface overclosure(s) left unresolved and will be
  stored as offsets. To help identify the nodes involved in the overclosures a
  node set InfoNodeUnresolvInitOver has been created.


  Maximum unresolved overclosure is 5.60776E-06 between node 25 of instance
  BLOCK-2-LIN-1-8-LIN-2-1-LIN-LIN-11-1 and the analytical rigid surface with
  reference node 1 of instance


***NOTE: You can view the deformed configuration due to the resolution of
         initial overclosures.  In increment 0, draw the deformed shape or
         draw a symbol plot of vector displacements.
